This was pretty basic as I had to learn how to use the moment API for the weather app - I guess that's what I get for not doing this when it was assigned.
I'm not that great with front-end design/development so I just used basic bootstrap components.
I used some FOR loops to go through the text blocks in order to populate with tasks from local storage, or color based on time.
I also implimented a "Clear" button so it would clear all local storage and then reload the page with no saved tasks.
